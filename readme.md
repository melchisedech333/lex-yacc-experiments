Here are my codes, studies and experiments in general, which I performed using the tools for context-free grammar analysis. They are <b>lex</b>, <b>yacc</b> and <b>bison</b>.

:hammer_and_wrench: Instructions
---

Each directory is equivalent to a specific test. And to compile run the file <b>compile-and-run.sh</b> passing the directory name as a parameter.

```bash
./compile-and-run.sh "2 - filter tokens"
```

After compiling, just run the generated file with the name <b>parsing</b>, and type the input.

```bash
./parsing
```

For this example in question (using the <b>2 - filter tokens</b>), a valid input could be:

```
10 20 30 A
```

For this input, the output will be:

```
type: INTEGER
token: 10

type: INTEGER
token: 20

type: INTEGER
token: 30

type: UNKNOWN
token: A
```

It is important to mention that within each directory there is a file called <b>input.txt</b>, which contain one (or more) possible example entries.
